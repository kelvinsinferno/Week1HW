## Week 1 Homework

https://kelvinsinferno.github.io/Week1HW/

The Horieson website focuses on SEO, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing.
We were asked to refactor the code so that it met accessibility standards. 

I have:
- Adjusted the semantics and structure so that it is more easy to navigate.
- added Alt attributes for broader accessibility.
- cleaned up the title element
